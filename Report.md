Time spent: 3 hours.

## Work Completed

I certify that I completed all steps in the lab using my own computer.

**Part C:** Tried to use an array iteration loop to fill the array of grades. 
Discovered that it is not intended to be used this way.
Wrote the program to store grades and output them all at once because that was what it looked like in sample input and output.
Found out that it was not supposed to work that way, and that the array was entirely unrequired so I removed it. 

## Known Issues
